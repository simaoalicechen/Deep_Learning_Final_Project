# Deep_Learning_Final_Project


# Preliminary Plan:
- Week of 4/19: Get the Basic GAN code working and train on anything. Train the GAN model on a specific class (and get good results by eyeballing it) âœ…
- Week of 4/26: Pretrained GAN -> Fine tune it using ImageNet Class from previous week. Compare images to trained from scratch GAN.
- Week of 5/3: Evaluate GAN images on image classification networks (Inception, ResNet50, ViT-Base, Llava)
- Week of 5/10:  Write report.
